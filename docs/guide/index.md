# Early access

Histoire is currently in early access - [the repository](https://github.com/Akryum/histoire) can only be accessed by our sponsors.

<div class="htw-flex htw-justify-center htw-my-12">
  <SponsorButton/>
</div>

You support will helps us build the best stories app based on [Vite](https://vitejs.dev)!

The early access will last a few weeks until we finish polishing the documentation and when we will feel it's ready to be tested by more people.
